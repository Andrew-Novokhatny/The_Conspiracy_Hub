[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I was born in a cross-fire hurricane
And I howled at the maw in the drivin' rain
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

[Verse 2]
I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

[Verse 3]
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
Yeah, yeah
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]
I was crowned with a spike right thru my head
My, my, yeah
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

[Outro]
Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas
