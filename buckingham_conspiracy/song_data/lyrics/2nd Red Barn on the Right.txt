Well, we find ourselves in the good hands
Of some hard workin’ boys
And we find ourselves on the good land
Gonna make some noise

And we find ourselves in a sweet jam
Goin’ on into the night
Me and the boys
Makin’ some noise
Second Red Barn on the Right

Singin Woo Hoo (Woo Hoo)
You know we’re feelin’ alright

Woo Hoo (Woo Hoo)
You know we’re getting’ it tight

Woo Hoo (Woo Hoo)
And you know we’re feelin’ alright
At the Second Red Barn on the Right

Well, we find ourselves in the good grace
Of some people who care
And you know they’re gonna make a good place
So stay right here

And you know they’re makin’ a strong stand
For what is right
Lendin’ a hand
Workin the land
Second Red Barn on the Right

Singin Woo Hoo (Woo Hoo)
You know we’re feelin’ alright

Woo Hoo (Woo Hoo)
You know we’re getting’ it tight

Woo Hoo (Woo Hoo)
And you know we’re feelin’ alright
At the Second Red Barn on the Right

Way up on Route 94
On the Jersey side
And down into Vernon Valley
So full of pride

For many a long, hard day
For many a sweet old night
Park your car
You know where you are
Second Red Barn on the Right

Singin Woo Hoo (Woo Hoo)
You know we’re feelin’ alright

Woo Hoo (Woo Hoo)
You know we’re getting’ it tight

Woo Hoo (Woo Hoo)
And you know we’re feelin’ alright
Me and the Boys
Makin’ some noise
At the Second Red Barn on the Right

Woo Hoo (Woo Hoo)
You know we’re feelin’ alright

Woo Hoo (Woo Hoo)
You know we’re getting’ it tight

Woo Hoo (Woo Hoo)
And you know we’re feelin’ alright
Me and the boys
Makin’ some noise
At the Second Red Barn on the Right
