[Part 1]
[Verse]
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy, what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what'd ya leave behind for me?
All in all, it was just a brick in the wall
All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall

[Outro]
Hey

[Intro]
[Verse 1:]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone

[Pre-Chorus: ]
Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!

[Chorus: ]
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

We don't need no education
Wе don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, lеave them kids alone

[Pre-Chorus: Islington Green School Students]
Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone!
[Chorus: Islington Green School Students]
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Wrong, do it again! (*Children playing*)
Wrong, do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
(Wrong, do it again!)
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
(Wrong, do it again!)
You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!
(If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?)
(You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!)

[Part 3]

[Intro]
*televisions being smashed*

[Verse]
I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No, don't think I'll need anything at all
[Chorus]
All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall
All in all, you were all just bricks in the wall
