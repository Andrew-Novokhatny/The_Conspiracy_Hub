 
[Chorus: Bob Marley]
Could you be loved and be love?
Could you be loved and be love?

[Verse 1: Bob Marley]
Don't let them fool ya
Or even try to school ya, oh no
We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell if what you're thinking isn't right
Love would never leave us alone
A-in the darkness, there must come out to light

[Chorus: Bob Marley]
Could you be loved and be love?
Could you be loved, woah, yeah
And be loved?

[Bridge: Backup Vocalists]
The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too
So while you point your fingers, someone else is judging you

[Refrain]
Love your brotherman
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?

[Verse 2: Bob Marley]
Don't let them change ya, oh
Or even rearrange ya
Oh no
We've got a life to live
(
Ooh, ooh, ooh
)
They say, only, only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive
Stay alive, eh

[Chorus: Bob Marley]
Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, woah yeah
And be loved?

[Bridge: Backup Vocals]
Never miss your water until your well runs dry
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied

[Outro: Bob Marley
