[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Move yourself
, you always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself, you are the move you make
Take your chances, win or lose her

[Verse 2]
See yourself, you are the steps you take
You and you, and that's the only way
Shake, shake yourself, you're every move you make
So the story goes

[Chorus]
Owner of a lonely heart, 
owner of a lonely heart (Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart
, owner of a lonely heart

[Verse 3]
Say you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now, 
the eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only

[Verse 4]
You, lose yourself, no, not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself, give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

[Chorus]
Owner of a lonely heart
, owner of a lonely heart (Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart, 
owner of a lonely heart

[Post-Chorus]
Owner of a lonely heart

[Bridge]
After my own indecision, they confused me so
 (Owner of a lonely heart)
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go, look before you leap
 (Owner of a lonely heart)
And don't you hesitate at all, no, no
Yow!

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Owner of a lonely heart, owner of a lonely heart 
(Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart, owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart, owner of a lonely heart (Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart, owner of a lonely heart

[Post-Chorus]
Owner of a lonely heart
