(Ghostbusters!)

[Verse 1]
If there's somethin' strange in your neighborhood
Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
If there's somethin' weird, and it don't look good
Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)

[Chorus]
I ain't afraid of no ghost
I ain't afraid of no ghost

[Verse 2]
If you're seein' things runnin' through your head
Who can you call? (Ghostbusters!)
An invisible man sleepin' in your bed
Oh, 
who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)

[Chorus]
I ain't afraid of no ghost
Uh, I ain't afraid of no ghost

[Verse 3]
Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
If you're all alone, 
pick up the phone
And call (Ghostbusters!)

[Bridge]
I ain't afraid of no ghost
Ooh, I hear it likes the girls
Hm, I ain't afraid of no ghost
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]
Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
Mm, if you've had a dose of a freaky ghost, baby
You'd better call (Ghostbusters!)

[Interlude]
Lemme tell ya somethin'
Bustin' makes me feel good

[Chorus]
I ain't afraid of no ghost
Uh, I ain't afraid of no ghost

Don't get caught alone, oh, no (Ghostbusters!)
When it comes through your door
Unless you just a-want some more
I think you'd better call (Ghostbusters!)
Ow!

Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
I think you'd better call (Ghostbusters!)

Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)

Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
