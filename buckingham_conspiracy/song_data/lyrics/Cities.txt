[Verse 1]
Think of London, small city
It's dark, dark in the daytime
People sleep, sleep in the daytime
If they want to, if they want to

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm checking 'em out, I'm checking 'em out
I got it figured out, I got it figured out
There's good points, some bad points
But it all works out, though I'm a little freaked out

[Chorus]
I'll find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in

[Verse 2]
Lot of rich people in Birmingham
Lot of ghosts in a lot of houses
Look over there, dry ice factory
Good place to get some thinking done

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm checking it out, I'm checking it out
I got it figured out, I got it figured out
There's good points, some bad points
But it all works out, you know I'm a little freaked out

[Chorus]
I'll find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in

[Instrumental break]

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm checking 'em out, I'm checking 'em out
I got it figured out, I got it figured out
There's good points, some bad points
But it all works out, sometimes I'm a little freaked out

[Chorus]
I'll find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in
Help me

[Verse 3]
Did I forget to mention, forget to mention Memphis?
Home of Elvis and the ancient Greeks
Do I smell? I smell home cooking
It's only the river, it's only the river

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm checking it out, I'm checking it out
I got it figured out, I got it figured out
There's good points, some bad points
But it all works out, sometimes I'm a little freaked out

[Chorus]
I'll find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in

[Outro]
Find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in
Find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in
