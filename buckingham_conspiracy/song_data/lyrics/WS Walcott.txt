[Verse 1]
When your arms are empty, got nowhere to go
Come on out and catch this show
There'll be saints and sinners, you'll see losers and winners
All kinds of people you might want to know
Once you get it, you can't forget it
W.S. Walcott Medicine Show

[Bridge]
You know he always holds it in a tent
And if you're looking for the real thing
He can show you where it went

[Verse 2]
There's a young faith healer, he's a woman stealer
He will cure by his command
When the music's hot, you might have to stand
To hear the Klondike Klu Klux Steamboat Band
Don't you sweat it, you can't forget it
W.S. Walcott Medicine Show

[Bridge]
I'd rather die happy than not die at all
For a man is a fool
Who will not heed the call

[Verse 3]
Gonna see Miss Brer Foxhole with bright diamonds in her teeth
She is pure gold down underneath
She's a rock and roll singer and a true dead ringer
Boy, somethin' like you ain't never seen
Once you get it, you can't forget it
W.S. Walcott Medicine Show

[Refrain]
W.S. Walcott Medicine Show
W.S. Walcott Medicine Show
W.S. Walcott Medicine Show
