[Verse 1]
Drive on
Until I get there
I think i’ll drive on
Until I get there

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a ram, yes I am
And I know just what to do
Think I’ll drive on
And try to get next to you

[Chorus]
Hey baby
‘Cause I'm a ram
Bet your life, I do
‘Cause I'm a ram now
And I wanna get next to you
Oh baby
Yeah
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Drive on
Until I get there
I think I'll drive on
Until I get there

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me say, 'cause I'm a ram, yes I am
And I'm as stubborn as I can be
I'm a ram, yes I am
Now try to get next to me

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm a ram, yeah
You bet your life you do
I'm a ram now
Wanna get next to you

[Verse 3]
Drive on
Until I get there
I think I'll drive on
Until I get there

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a ram out in the bush
And he needs to be free
Won't somebody please
Come and see about me?

[Chorus]
Hey, 'cause I'm a ram now
Bet your life i do
'Cause I'm a ram now
Wanna get next to you!

[Outro]
Oh thank you
Right now

'Cause I'm a ram
Drive on

Drive on

Gotta, gotta keep on driving
I'm as selfish as I can be
I'm a ram now
Try to get next to me
Baby
Oh my my
Oh, oh my my my my my
