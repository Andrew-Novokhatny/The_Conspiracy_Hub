[Verse 1]
When you gonna make time for me?
What you gotta lose?
I'm wasting time so you've better
Stop and choose
You put me off and I'm dreaming
Of better ground
How would you feel if
I didn't come around?

[Chorus]
Elizabeth is waiting
Elizabeth is waiting somewhere
I don't mean to force ya
Whatcha gotta prove?
Just think about it and maybe
Make a move
You can call me when you've decided
I've had enough
Don't take my questions for granted
It's getting way too tough because

[Chorus]
Elizabeth is waiting
Elizabeth's waiting somewhere

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think I should I cut it
But I can't let go
She's got the time for my answers
But she doesn't know it now

[Chorus]
Elizabeth is waiting
Elizabeth's waiting somewhere
