[Verse 1]
Hey, little sister, what have you done?
Hey, little sister, who's the only one?
Hey, little sister, who's your Superman?
Hey, little sister, who's the one you want?
Hey, little sister, shotgun

[Chorus]
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again

[Verse 2]
Hey, little sister, who is it you're with? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hey, little sister, what's your vice or wish?
 (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hey, little sister, shotgun, oh yeah
Hey, little sister, who's your Superman?
Hey, little sister, shotgun

[Chorus]
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again, ow!

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
Pick it up
Take me back home, yeah

[Verse 3]
Hey, little sister, what have you done? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, hey, little sister, who's the only one? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I've been away for so long
I've been away for so long
I let you go for so long

[Chorus]
It's a nice day to start again
Come on, it's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again, wow!

[Bridge]
There is nothin' fair in this world, girl
There is nothin' safe in this world
And there's nothin' sure in this world
And there's nothin' pure in this world
Look for something left in this world
Start again

[Outro]
Come on, It's a nice day for a white wedding, wow!
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day to start again
