Girl, what are you waiting for
You've been in your own way before
Make your move

Girl... there's so much more, I swear
Let down your hair, what's there to lose

You know it's gonna stay the way it is, if you don't change the way it is

Move
Move
Move

Take your time, I'm not going anywhere
But you gotta know
That if you're feeling down inside
Then what you've got to show me
Is you can throw off your despair
And where you're going
When you get there is up to you

Girl... there's so much more, I swear
Let down your hair, what's there to lose

You know it's gonna stay the way it is, if you don't change the way it is

Move
Move
Move
