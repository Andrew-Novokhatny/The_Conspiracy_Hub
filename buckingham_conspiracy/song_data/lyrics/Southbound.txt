[Verse 1]
Well I'm southbound, Lord I'm comin' home to you
Lord I'm southbound, baby, Lord I'm comin' home to you
I got that old lonesome feelin' that's sometimes called the blues

[Verse 2]
Lord I been workin' every night or travelin' every day
Lord I been workin' every night or travelin' every day
Oh, you can tell your other man, sweet daddy's on the way
Oh, you better believe

[Chorus]
Well, I'm southbound
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, I said I'm southbound, baby
Oh, you better tell your other man sweet daddy's on his way
Oh, here I come, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Got your hands full now baby, as soon as I hit that door
Got your hands full now woman, Lord soon as I hit that door
Well I'm gonna make it on up to you
For all the things you should have had before

[Chorus]
So I'm goin' southbound
Oh, southbound, babe
Oh, I'm goin' southbound, yeah babe
Gonna make it on up to you
For all the things you should have had before
