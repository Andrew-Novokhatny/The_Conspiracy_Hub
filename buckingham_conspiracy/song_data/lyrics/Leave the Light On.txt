[Verse]
When the fall begins
Time will come to take me in
I'll be strong I hope
You'll do the same
I would stay you know
But my honor bids me go
Just a pawn lost in
Another rich man's game

[Chorus]
Leave the light on for me lady
So in the darkness I can find my way home
Leave your light on for me lady
Let me know that I'm not alone

[Verse]
Five years have passed us by
Not one without you on my mind
Your face is all I ever dream of
It's so cold at night
I pretend that it's all right
But I keep your candle burning in the window

[Chorus]
Leave the light on for me lady
So in the darkness I can find my way home
Leave your light on for me lady
Let me know that I'm not alone

[Verse]
It's been ten years now
Since I struck that rich man down
As he tried to take you for his own
Can you see my light?
I pray it guides you home at night
'Cause I'm tired of sleeping all alone

[Chorus]
So leave the light on for me lady
So in the darkness I can find my way home
Leave your light on for me lady
Let me know that I'm not alone
Leave the light on for me lady
So in the darkness I can find my way home
Leave your light on for me lady
Let me know that I'm not alone
